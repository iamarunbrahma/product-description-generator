# Product Description Generator

Generate SEO-compliant product descriptions using product titles and meta-keywords provided by the user.
Implemented custom LLMChain function from the Langchain and few-shot prompting technique to generate multi-paragraph rich text product description for each product name and its corresponding keywords. Built a gradio app as a frontend demo to showcase the process.

This project is hosted on HuggingFace Spaces: [Live Demo of Product Description Generator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/heliosbrahma/product-description-generator).

## Steps:-
- Provide the product name and keywords separated by commas
- Using the custom prompt template and ChatOpenAI model, call the custom LLM chain to generate a product description
